Everyone who would like to learn about data management and DataLad is invited to participate. The target audience are researchers of all career stages at the Institute of Systems Neuroscience of the University Clinic Hamburg . Costs? The workshop is free to attend. Why would you want to join? \u00b6 Research Data Management is a core component of good scientific practice and can help to make your work not only more reproducible and transparent - but also easier. Ever worked through such a directory? Is this metaphor fitting to a paper of yours? Have you ever looked like this trying to figure out how a colleagues script is supposed to work (or an old script of yourself)? Do you find yourself wondering how to share or publish the data and results of your recent project? This virtual workshop, spread over two half-days, will introduce core concepts and software tools that can make your next research project easier: Version control, principles for data analysis, data publication, and collaborative scientific workflows using well-known and free services such as GitHub or Gin . The workshop will be virtual and free to attend. Workshop Contents \u00b6 The workshop will center around DataLad , an open source software tool for data versioning, data management and data publication that builds up on the industry standard Git and git-annex . Beyond introducing its functionality, we will cover useful core concepts for good research data management and reproducible, open science: Version control for code and data, productive usage of services such as GitHub and Gin, provenance capture for reproducible analysis, organizational principles for data analysis, and workflows and services for data publication and collaboration - in conjunction with demonstrating readily-applicable workflows or examples. This workshop can be interesting for you if you have always wanted to get going with version control, are curious to find out when and how to use DataLad, or want see real-world workflows for reproducible science. Logistics \u00b6 Location, date and time The workshop will take place virtually in two half-days, from 9am to 1pm (Berlin time) on Thursday, 21 st of April, and Friday, 22 nd of April. Small breaks will be provided. Materials and recordings will be made available publicly after the workshop. Registration Attendance is free, but a registration is required. To register for the workshop, please fill out this online form . It also includes a short survey to help to better prepare for audience of the workshop. Your e-mail address will be used to send out further information as well as log in details to the virtual meeting. Your data will be not be stored beyond the workshop, and is only used for workshop coordination. In case of any questions about the registration, please write an e-mail to adina.wagner@t-online.de . Preparation The workshop will be held via Zoom . We plan to provide browser-based access to a Jupyter Lab instance for every participant, but you can also use your own computer. Participants planning to make use of the Jupyter Lab instance do not need to prepare in advance. We ask participants that want to use their own computer to prepare by installing and testing all required software prior to the workshop, and reach out early in advance to the instructors if they require help. As the workshop is virtual, trouble-shooting during the workshop is only possible in a limited form. Instructions can be found in the section Preparations for participants . Code of Conduct We ask all participants to adhere to a code of conduct for the virtual meeting. It can be found in the section Code of Conduct . Questions Do you have questions or are missing information on this website? Here are your options: Please check out the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) which might already provide an answer to your question. Please open a new Issue on GitHub .

At the end of this page, a short script can help you to verify that everything works as it should. If you run into problems, please get in touch prior to the workshop. We are happy to help with installation problems or general questions, but a virtual workshop does not allow for any concurrent user support and help, unfortunately, and we thus won't be able to deal with problems that surface during the sessions. Reach out to us about problems as early as you can by filing an issue on our GitHub repository: github.com/adswa/dl-workshop . If you haven't set up the software, you can log into a Jupyter Hub instance we will provide. NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS DataLad and its underlying tools work less well on Windows. An honest assessment can be found in the DataLad handbook . Alternatively to using your Windows OS you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (2), your institutions high-performance compute cluster, or the provided Jupyter hub. NOTE FOR HCP/HTC USERS If you want to use shared high-performance or high-throughput infrastructure, but there is no DataLad installation yet, you can either install the required software on a per-user basis (no root privileges required) following instructions in the DataLad Handbook, or you can ask your system's administrator to install the software. Feel free to share adina.wagner@t-online.de as a point of contact for additional information and handbook.datalad.org/r.html?install for installation instructions. An intro to the command line \u00b6 During the workshop we will primarily work with the command line. If you are using your own computer, but are not used to typing in your computer's terminal, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the basics. You can find a short tutorial here . Software installation \u00b6 The following software is required to follow along interactively. Please install it as early as you can DataLad : handbook.datalad.org/intro/installation.html (depending on installation method and operating system, Git and git-annex can already be included a DataLad installation) Git : git-scm.com git-annex : git-annex.branchable.com/ Check your installation \u00b6 To check whether everything worked out, please run the following command in your terminal (without the leading $ ): $ datalad -f'{infos[git-annex][version]}' wtf 8.20200330 If this returns a version number as above (it does not need to be identical to 8.20200330 ), you're good! \ud83d\udc4d Potential errors: If you see the following, your Git identity isn't configured yet: It is highly recommended to configure Git before using DataLad. Set both 'user.name' and 'user.email' configuration variables. If you don't get a version number of N/A , git-annex is missing. Please double check by typing git-annex into your terminal and pressing enter - if your shell responds with command not found , please install git-annex . If your shell returns command not found , DataLad is missing. Please double check by retrying this operation in a new shell or typing rehash beforehand.

Questions, maybe discuss usecases To do and to plan \u00b6 Infrastructure Private computers (without question if virtual), (guest/existing?) user accounts on a cluster? If if-person: Hygiene standards to comply to Recording set up Recording publication (platforms, time frame (live streaming, publishing post-workshop/...)) ======= Idea: Migrate this repository to the handbook repository, keep mkdocs, and create a github page under the handbook namespace -> easier to find, more lasting resource Virtual attendance procedures: Client (Zoom/Jitsi/Hangouts), procedures for participation (how/when to raise questions, interactivity?) Accessibilty: IMO, it can be as open as possible - at least recordings and materials should be openly shared.
