The workshop is free to attend. About \u00b6 Research Data Management is a core component of good scientific practice and can help to make your work not only more reproducible and transparent - but also easier. Ever worked through such a directory? Is this metaphor fitting to a recent paper of yours? Have you ever looked like this trying to figure out how a colleagues script is supposed to work (or an old script of yourself)? In this full-day workshop, organized as part of the Reproducible Neuroimaging ( ReproNim ) initiative to improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging science, ReproNim fellows will introduce core concepts and software tools that can make your next research project easier: Version control, principles for data analysis, data publication, and collaborative scientific workflows. The workshop will be virtual and free to attend. Workshop Contents \u00b6 The workshop will center around DataLad , an open source software tool for data management and data publication. We will introduce core concepts of good research data management - joint version control of code and data, provenance capture for reproducible analysis, organizational principles for data analysis, and workflows and services for data publication and collaboration - in conjunction with demonstrating readily-applicable workflows or examples. If you have always wanted to get going with version control, are curious to find out how to use DataLad, or want see simple workflows for reproducible science - from data sharing to reproducible papers - this workshop will be useful and easier than you think. Logistics \u00b6 Location, date and time The workshop will take place virtually, at UTC+2 (Berlin time) at Wednesday, November 18 th 2020. It is scheduled as a full-day event (including breaks). Materials and recordings will be made available publicly after the workshop. Registration Attendance is free, but a registration is required.

This website is written in MarkDown - you can find a style guide here . The website is build with mkdocs . If you want to preview your changes, build the website locally by installing the requirements in the root of the repository ( pip install -r requirements.txt ) and running mkdocs serve . The website will be build and served at http://127.0.0.1:8000 . If your satisfied, add and commit your changes. Afterwards, push them to your fork of the repository on GitHub. The command will likely look like this: git push origin <yourbranchname> Finally, you will be able to open up a pull request online by clicking \"create PR\" in the web interface. This was only a quick rundown of the steps towards a pull request.

At the end of this page, a short script can help you to verify that everything works as it should. If you run into problems, please get in touch prior to the workshop. We are happy to help with installation problems or general questions, but a virtual workshop does not allow for any concurrent user support and help, unfortunately, and we thus won't be able to deal with problems that surface during the sessions. Reach out to us about problems as early as you can by filing an issue on our GitHub repository: github.com/adswa/mpi-datamanagement-ws/ . If you haven't set up the software, you will be able to attend the workshop, but not work interactively on the materials. NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS Previous workshop experiences have taught us that the installation of all required software is more complex on Windows systems. As there is also less available support for Windows users, we generally recommend that anyone who uses Windows should switch to an account on a shared compute cluster instead of using their private PC for this introduction, if possible. This eases the installation effort greatly. An intro to the command line \u00b6 During the workshop we will primarily work with the command line. If you are not used to typing in your computer's terminal, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the basics. You can find a short tutorial here . Software installation \u00b6 The following software is required to follow along interactively. Please install it as early as you can DataLad : handbook.datalad.org/intro/installation.html (depending on installation method and operating system, Git and git-annex can already be included a DataLad installation) Git : git-scm.com git-annex : git-annex.branchable.com/ Software setup \u00b6 If you haven't yet, please make sure to Configure Git and Create an SSH key prior to the workshop. During the workshop, we will demonstrate workflows that involve digital infrastructure from the MPIB, in particular the MPIB GitLab instance and the MPIB Keeper instance . If you are affiliated with the MPIB and interested in working through these workflows as well, please make sure that you have a user account on both services. Configure Git If you haven't yet used Git, you should configure it with your name and e-mail address. This information is used to connect saved changes with your person. The configuration can be done directly from the command line: $ git config --global --add user.name \"Bob McBobFace\" $ git config --global --add user.email bob@example.com Set up an SSH key An SSH key is an access credential in the SSH protocol that can be used to login from one system to remote servers and services, such as from your private computer to an SSH server or to GitHub, without supplying your username or password at each visit. To use an SSH key for authentication, you need to generate a key pair on the system you would like to use to access a remote system or service (your computer or the cluster you use during this workshop). The pair consists of a private and a public key - basically two files with lots of gibberish. The public key file is shared with the remote server, and the private key file is used to authenticate your machine whenever you want to access the remote server or service. Services such as GitHub and GitLab use SSH keys and the SSH protocol to ease access to Git repositories. This tutorial by GitHub is a detailed step-by-step instruction to generate and use SSH keys for authentication. We recommend to also follow Step 3 of the tutorial and add the SSH key to your GitHub account. Check your installation \u00b6 To check whether everything worked out, please run the following command in your terminal (without the leading $ ): $ datalad -f'{infos[git-annex][version]}' wtf 8.20200330 If this returns a version number as above (it does not need to be identical to 8.20200330 ), you're good! \ud83d\udc4d Potential errors: If you see the following, your Git identity isn't configured yet: It is highly recommended to configure Git before using DataLad. Set both 'user.name' and 'user.email' configuration variables. If you don't get a version number of N/A , git-annex is missing. Please double check by typing git-annex into your terminal and pressing enter - if your shell responds with command not found , please install git-annex . If your shell returns command not found , DataLad is missing. Please double check by retrying this operation in a new shell or typing rehash beforehand.

Questions, maybe discuss usecases To do and to plan \u00b6 Infrastructure Private computers (without question if virtual), (guest/existing?) user accounts on a cluster? If if-person: Hygiene standards to comply to Recording set up Recording publication (platforms, time frame (live streaming, publishing post-workshop/...)) ======= Idea: Migrate this repository to the handbook repository, keep mkdocs, and create a github page under the handbook namespace -> easier to find, more lasting resource Virtual attendance procedures: Client (Zoom/Jitsi/Hangouts), procedures for participation (how/when to raise questions, interactivity?) Accessibilty: IMO, it can be as open as possible - at least recordings and materials should be openly shared.
